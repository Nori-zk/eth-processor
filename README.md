# Mina zkApp: Eth-processor

## How to build

```sh
npm run build
```

## Configuration

Env vars (create a .env file):

```
MINA_RPC_NETWORK_URL=
SENDER_PRIVATE_KEY=
ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY=
TX_FEE=

ZKAPP_PRIVATE_KEY=
ZKAPP_ADDRESS=

NETWORK=

ETH_VERIFIER_VK_HASH=
ETH_PROCESSOR_VK_HASH=
```

- **MINA_RPC_NETWORK_URL**: Mina network RPC endpoint URL.
- **SENDER_PRIVATE_KEY**: private key of the transaction sender.
- **ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY**: private key for administrative control operations.
- **TX_FEE**: transaction fee to be used when submitting transactions.

- **ZKAPP_PRIVATE_KEY**: private key for the zkApp account. Will be generated by `npm run deploy` if not provided and written to `.env.nori-eth-processor`.
- **ZKAPP_ADDRESS**: deployed address of the zkApp contract. Will be generated by `npm run deploy` and written to `.env.nori-eth-processor`.

- **NETWORK**: specifies the target network (e.g., `mainnet`, `devnet`, `litenet`).

- **ETH_VERIFIER_VK_HASH**: The hash of the EthVerifier verification key. Will be generated by `npm run deploy` and written to `.env.nori-eth-processor`.
- **ETH_PROCESSOR_VK_HASH**: The hash of the EthProcessor contract verification key. Will be generated by `npm run deploy` and written to `.env.nori-eth-processor`.


## How to deploy (for the first time)

Setup your `.env` file in the root directory. Set `MINA_RPC_NETWORK_URL=<url>`, `NETWORK=<mainnet or devnet or litenet>` and your `SENDER_PRIVATE_KEY`.

Run `npm run deploy`. After which `.env.nori-eth-processor` will have been created in the root directory of the project.

```
ETH_VERIFIER_VK_HASH=<some hash string>
ETH_PROCESSOR_VK_HASH=<some hash string>
```

Copy these to your `.env` file.

## How to submit a new converter proof

Edit the `src/proofs/sp1Proof.json` file from the output you got from proof conversion (See [EthVerifier.ts](./src/EthVerifier.ts)). Note you only need to update `nodeVk.json` if the bridge head has ZK program VK has change, `p0.json` if the proof conversion program VK has changed and sp1Proof.json needs to change for each and every new eth transition proof output. Each time your bridge head ZK / proof conversion ZK has changed you would need to redeploy the Mina smart contract with `npm run deploy` (TODO).

Then finally: `npm run prove-and-submit`

## How to re-deploy

This is a work in progress. 

## Troubleshooting

There are constant problems with 01js's cache mechanism. If you expect your projects ETH_VERIFIER_VK_HASH / ETH_PROCESSOR_VK_HASH to change due to a ZK change. Then remove the `~/.cache/o1js/` contents
before running `npm run deploy` and updating them.

## How to run tests

Obtain your SENDER_PRIVATE_KEY environment variable:

1. `npm install -g zkapp-cli`
2. `zk lightnet start`
3. `curl localhost:8181/acquire-account`
4. Put the `sk` in your `.env` file: SENDER_PRIVATE_KEY=......
5. Put `MINA_RPC_NETWORK_URL=http://localhost:8080/graphql` in your `.env` file.
6. Put `NETWORK=lightnet` in your `.env` file.
7. Run `npm run deploy`
8. Copy `ETH_VERIFIER_VK_HASH` and `ETH_PROCESSOR_VK_HASH` from `.env.nori-eth-processor` into your `.env` file.

```sh
npm run test # all tests
npm run test -- -t "should perform a series of proof submissions" # run a specific test
npm run testw # watch mode
```

Note tests can hang after a 3rd round of proof computation. Try running them one by one like `npm run test --t <testName>` if this this is happening to you.

## How to run coverage

```sh
npm run coverage
```
